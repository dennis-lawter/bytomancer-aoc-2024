My solution repository for Advent of Code 2024.

## Spoiler Warning
Within the `src/solutions` and `lua_src/solutions` folders,
you will see my code to solve Advent of Code 2024.

If you wish to remain spoiler free,
avoid these folders!

## Objective
I've decided on a few objectives this year for Advent of Code.
- As I have done all years, I will not use any AI tools.
- I still wish to solve each problem as fast as I can using Rust.
- I'd like to return to each problem and solve them in Fennel.

I also see no value for myself in using AI to complete the problems;
I'm using Advent of Code to learn and improve.

I was debating about not doing Rust,
but I wanted to feel okay going to sleep at 1AM after making some submission,
and I didn't believe it was likely if I attempted Fennel first.

Fennel will be my first real introduction to lisps.
Obviously there are countless lisp dialects out there,
but it was extremely easy to incorporate Fennel into my existing tooling.
Additionally, Fennel made the most sense to me,
as Lua appears quite often in game development,
which is where I tend to focus much of my personal project time.
